	    This is a basic blog about my Cyber Security Experiences. I am a Lead Threat hunter for a SOC and a cybersecurity bootcamp instructor. I have built and managed 2 SOCs previously. My technology passions include everything Linux and FOSS related, as well as programming.

                <h4>Steganograpy: hidden messages in plain sight. </h4>
                <p>This beautify Butterfly Picture contains a hidden message that you can easily extract. 
		<br><br>
		I remeber listening to a podcast about cryptography and hearing someone describe hiding information in the pixels of an image. I was very intrigued by this idea and after 
		some thought I figured I would give it a try. I knew that the pixel information is represented by numbers between 0 and 255 for RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) with PNG files. 
		I also knew that computers can represent more colors than the human eye can distinguish. Using this information I figured I could write a program that interpreted the values to 
		represent the hidden data. I decided that all even numbers would represent a '0' and all odd numbers would represent a '1'. this means I can encode data while only slightly changing 
		the color of the pixel. the slight color change might be noticable to a computer but would be to small for a human to recognize. I then wrote several python program that would take 
		some form of data (ie. Text, File, etc) and hide it in a PNG picture, assuimg it had enough pixels to fit all the data in it. Using the information and code found at: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/tree/master/Python/Steganography">https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/tree/master/Python/Steganography</a>
		you can also hide or extract messages from PNG images.

		In this case the Buttefly Picture contains a pdf copy of my old resume.

                <h3>Burning XCSSET Malware</h3>
                <h4>When a spy is "burned", it means that they have been discovered.</h4>
                <p>
                    I helped a company with an infection, we figured out it was known as XCSSET. In my research of the Malware we found, and the information online I put together a script 
		    to systematically download each version of the Malware from each server they have check its SHA256 hash against a list of already downloaded malware and if it is unique 
		    (to me) upload it to virus total. I named the Project BurnItAll because my goal was to frustrate the Malware distributor by downloading every new copy and having it flagged by all 
		    anti-virus programs before they had a chance to use it against some one in the wild. The other side effect was I was eating up this Threat Actors resources. Both website bandwidth and 
		    ability to churn out new, slightly modified, version of the malware. 
		<br><br>
		    <b>WARNING: </b> this github page contains real samples of the XCSSET Malware saved in zip files. While it was meant to work on Mac OS X it can also run on Linux Operating Systems. 
		    <b>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! </b>
		<br><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/blob/master/Bash/BurnItAll/BurnItAll.sh">https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/blob/master/Bash/BurnItAll/BurnItAll.sh</a> 
		is the script I used to check all know websites and ip addresses for XCSSET and attempt to download all the malware. Once all his bases are belong to me, I would upload them 
		VirusTotal. VirusTotal would always see it as a new piece of malware do to the small changes the Threat Actors were making to it with each new download. These changes cost the 
		threat actors money since it takes processing power and intelligence to setup a system that could churn out new versions with each download. My goal was not to shut them down but 
		to inflate their cost beyond the point it is profittable for them. I was able to run this campaigne or about 2 weeks before all the websites were taken down completely.
