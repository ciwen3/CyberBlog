                <h4>Steganograpy: hidden messages in plain sight. </h4>
                <p>This beautify Butterfly Picture contains a hidden message that you can easily extract.

		I remeber listening to a podcast about cryptography and hearing someone describe hiding information in the pixels of an image. I was very intrigued by this idea and after 
		some thought I figured I would give it a try. I knew that the pixel information is represented by numbers between 0 and 255 for RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) with PNG files. 
		I also knew that computers can represent more colors than the human eye can distinguish. Using this information I figured I could write a program that interpreted the values to 
		represent the hidden data. I decided that all even numbers would represent a '0' and all odd numbers would represent a '1'. this means I can encode data while only slightly changing 
		the color of the pixel. the slight color change might be noticable to a computer but would be to small for a human to recognize. I then wrote several python program that would take 
		some form of data (ie. Text, File, etc) and hide it in a PNG picture, assuimg it had enough pixels to fit all the data in it. Using the information and code found at: 
		<a href="https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/tree/master/Python/Steganography">https://github.com/ciwen3/Public/tree/master/Python/Steganography</a>
		you can also hide or extract messages from PNG images.

		In this case the Buttefly Picture contains a pdf copy of my old resume.
